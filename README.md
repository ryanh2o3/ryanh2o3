### 🔭 Currently Working On
- I’m currently working on a **surf forecasting app** for my local surf spots so that's what most of the repos here revolve around.
- You'll find the **backend code** for the application, written in **Go**, along with some **ingestion microservices** written in **Python** with ongoing migrations planned to Go.
- There is also the **webapp** for the application and I'm also currently working on a **Swift** version of the app for iOS.
- 🌐 **Live Site:** You can view the webapp at [treblesurf.com](https://treblesurf.com) (Best optimized for mobile).

### 🛠 Tech Stack
> Over the past 2 years, all parts of the application have gone through major changes and rewrites. This includes migrating the backend from **Python/Flask** to **Go/Gin** and migrating from **Google Cloud/Firebase** to **AWS**. 

**Languages & Frameworks**
Go, Gin, Python, Flask, Vue

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
AWS, Dynamo, Lambda, Google cloud run

*The backend is now hosted in a Lambda using DynamoDB which keeps the running costs very low for me.*

### ⛵ Other Projects
- **Boat Tracking Project:** A small project I worked on to run on a **Raspberry Pi**, posting location data to a server to link into **Home Assistant**.
