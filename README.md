- 🔭 I’m currently working on a surf forecasting app for my local surf spots so that's what most of the repos here revolve around.
- You'll find the backend code for the application, written in Go, along with some ingestion microservices written in python with ongoing migrations planned to go
- There is also the webapp for the application and I'm also currently working on a Swift version of the app for ios
- You can view the webapp at [treblesurf.com](treblesurf.com)
